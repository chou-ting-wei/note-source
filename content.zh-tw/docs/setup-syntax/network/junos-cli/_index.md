## Reset the Switch

To revert a Juniper EX2300 switch to its factory-default configuration using the Factory Reset/Mode button, follow these corrected steps:

1. Press the Factory Reset/Mode button for 10 seconds
   > The switch transitions into factory-default configuration, the console displays committing factory default configuration, and the Link/Activity LED on the RJ-45 network ports and the uplink ports is lit steadily in green color.
2. Press the Factory Reset/Mode button for 10 more seconds
   > The switch transitions into initial setup mode, the console displays committing ezsetup config, and the Link/Activity LED on the RJ-45 network ports and the uplink ports blink in green color.
